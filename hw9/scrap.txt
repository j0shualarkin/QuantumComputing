}$ has the string 000 as its hidden subgroup generator. 

This means the function implemented by the oracle is injective. 

We see this from the property of the function: 
$\forall x,y \in B^3. \ f(x) = f(y) \iff x \oplus y \in \{000\}$ 

Because it naturally follows that $f(x) = f(y) \iff x = y$, since $x \oplus y = 000 \Rightarrow x = y$.
